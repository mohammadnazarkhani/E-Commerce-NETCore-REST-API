# MockSmsProvider Project Requirements

This project should primarily provide SMS capability for the TondForoosh project to send messages to users for login purposes and to receive dynamic passwords for online payments. Therefore, these capabilities should be implemented first before getting involved in complex development issues or implementing real-world SMS service capabilities.

## Expected Functional Capabilities in Version 0.0.0

1. Ability to login or create an account by entering a user account (phone number or company name)
2. Ability to view received messages
3. An API providing SMS sending capability
